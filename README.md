# Coordinates of Penrose tiling
===============================
 Coordinates and site connectivity  of Penrose tiling generated by iteratively applying the inflation-deflation rule (generation 1 to 7). We regard each vertex of the rhombuses as a site. The coordinates of every sites are found in "gen#/coordinate.txt", where the length of each edge is set to be 1. The order of the data in "coordinate" refers to the numbering denoted in the image (gen#/map.png) of each cluster. This numbering is also used in "gen#/nnbond.txt", which shows pairs of sites connected by each edge of the rhombuses.
